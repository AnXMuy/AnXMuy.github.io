[DescribeEarth: Describe Anything for Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25654)

Kaiyu Li*, **Zixuan Jiang\***, Xiangyong Cao☨, Jiayu Wang, Yuchen Xiao, Deyu Meng, Zhi Wang

**Open-source**: [code](https://github.com/earth-insights/DescribeEarth), [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/earth-insights/DE-Dataset), [benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/earth-insights/DE-Benchmark)
- We introduce geo-spatial detailed localized captioning.
- We build the first describe anything model in remote sensing.
- We release the related dataset and benchmark.
